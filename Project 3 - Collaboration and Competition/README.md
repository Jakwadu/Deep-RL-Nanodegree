# Project 3: Collaboration and Competition

This repository contains a solution to [Project 3](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/p3_collab-compet) of Udacity's Deep RL Nanodegree. The agent uses self play combined with the DDPG algorithm.

**State Space Dimensions = 24 (3 X 8 dimensional stacked representation)**

**Action Space Dimentions = 2**

The training script can be executed using the following command:

```
python run.py
```

Python installation prerequisites can be installed using pip:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: run.py assumes that the Tennis environment root directory is in the same place as the training script (eg. './Tennis_Windows_x86_64/Tennis.exe')*
